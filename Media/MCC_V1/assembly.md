|![SilcRing](schematics/SilcRing.png)|silcRing: This plastic piece allows for holding and compressing the silicone seal between the bells and the metal core to ensure the system's watertightness.|
|![peltier](schematics/pel.png)|Peltier Module: Produces cold on one side and heat on the other when supplied with electricity. This component is used to extract energy from the ice.|
|![sfan](schematics/sfan.png)|Upper fans (X8): These fans are used to draw air into the system around the radiator, ensuring uniform cooling.|
|![rad](schematics/rad.png)|Radiator: Dissipates Peltier's heat using air.|
|![vent](schematics/vent.png)|Main Fan: Pulls air out of the system, ensuring optimal airflow.|
|![corps](schematics/corps.png)|Corps: The main part of the assembly. It serves to maintain the entire structure.|
|![Bottom](schematics/Bottom.png)|Bottom: The piece supporting the assembly. It serves to ensure sufficient space for the escape of air from the radiator.|
