# Assembly of MCC V1


The Version 1 of the Mobile Cryo Capsule has a vertical assembly, with most components being attached towards the central body. An interractive view of the project can be seen at https://jeeezzus.github.io/MDT_Three.JS/.

Here is a representation of each part of the project

|Part|Description|
|-|-|
|![outerBell](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/gcloche.png)|Outer Bell: A transparent glass bell serving as an external insulating wall.|
|![innerBell](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/pcloche.png)|Inner Bell: A transparent glass bell serving as an internal insulating wall and container for ice.|
|![top](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/top.png)|Cover:A decorative piece that conceals the silicone joint.|
|![silcRing](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/SilcRing.png)|silcRing: This plastic piece allows for holding and compressing the silicone seal between the bells and the metal core to ensure the system's watertightness.|
|![peletier](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/pel.png)|Peltier Module: Produces cold on one side and heat on the other when supplied with electricity. This component is used to extract energy from the ice.|
|![sfan](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/sfan.png)|Upper fans (X8): These fans are used to draw air into the system around the radiator, ensuring uniform cooling.|
|![radiator](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/rad.png)|Radiator: Dissipates Peltier's heat using air.|
|![vent](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/vent.png)|Main Fan: Pulls air out of the system, ensuring optimal airflow.|
|![corps](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/corps.png)|Corps: The main part of the assembly. It serves to maintain the entire structure.|
|![Bottom](../../Media/MCC_V1/schematics/Bottom.png)|Bottom: The piece supporting the assembly. It serves to ensure sufficient space for the escape of air from the radiator.|
