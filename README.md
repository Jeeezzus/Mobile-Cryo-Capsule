# Mobile-Cryo-Capsule
|||
|-|-|
|Mobile Cryo Capsule is a visionary project blending art and environmental advocacy. Its centerpiece is a piece of Arctic ice, encapsulated in a glass bell, symbolizing the fragility of Earth's ecosystems. Inside the ice is a unique artifact: a human ear made from biodegradable collagen, containing DNA-encoded manifest for Earth. This represents the need to listen and respond to our planet's urgent messages. The project's hardware keeps the ice perpetually frozen, mirroring the challenge of preserving our changing world. Mobile Cryo Capsule serves as a stark reminder and an educational tool, urging viewers to reflect on their relationship with nature and advocate for sustainability and conservation. This exhibit is not just visually striking, but carries a profound message, emphasizing the importance of protecting our planet.|![MCC-V1](<Media/MCC_V1/MCC_v1 (5).jpeg>)|

## Thermal considerations
In an approach to sustainability and energy efficiency, the Mobile Cryo Capsule project incorporates the use of a Peltier module, positioned at the base of the glass bell. This module harnesses the thermal energy of the ice, reducing the impact of the thermal bridge – a process that significantly diminishes heat transfer between the ice and the base of the Artic Freezer. To further optimize energy consumption, the project employs an insulation technique by creating a vacuum, or an area of extremely low pressure, between two layers of the glass bell. By that we significantly enhance the insulation properties of the system. This method effectively isolates the ice from external air, maintaining its frozen state with minimal energy use.

At the heart of the Mobile Cryo Capsule project lies the Peltier module, a thermoelectric technology capable of creating a temperature differential of up to 50°C. This module operates on the Peltier effect, where an electric current causes a temperature difference across two different materials, thus enabling the transfer of heat. To optimize the performance of this module, a critical challenge is to effectively dissipate heat from its hot side, ensuring the cold side remains below freezing. For this purpose, the project employs a cooling solution inspired by advanced computer hardware. A central CPU cooler, akin to a main heatsink, is employed to draw heat away from the module. This is further augmented by a ring of eight smaller fans, strategically positioned to distribute airflow uniformly around the heatsink. This setup not only efficiently cools the hot side back to a manageable 30-35°C but also maintains the cold side at subzero temperatures.
