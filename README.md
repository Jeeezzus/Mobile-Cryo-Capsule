At the heart of the Arctic Freezer project lies the Peltier module, a thermoelectric technology capable of creating a temperature differential of up to 50°C. This module operates on the Peltier effect, where an electric current causes a temperature difference across two different materials, thus enabling the transfer of heat. To optimize the performance of this module, a critical challenge is to effectively dissipate heat from its hot side, ensuring the cold side remains below freezing. For this purpose, the project employs a cooling solution inspired by advanced computer hardware. A central CPU cooler, akin to a main heatsink, is employed to draw heat away from the module. This is further augmented by a ring of eight smaller fans, strategically positioned to distribute airflow uniformly around the heatsink. This setup not only efficiently cools the hot side back to a manageable 30-35°C but also maintains the cold side at subzero temperatures.
