# Security informations for the Mobile Cryo Capsule

Here are some safety instructions for the project. If anything goes wrong, the first thing to do is <span style="color:red">shut down everything</span> (see below).

The major risk of the system is its high power consumption (150W at peak during start-up). The two side-effects are that the Peltier module produces a lot of heat and that water is very close to the electricity.

## Shutting Down Everything
Shutting down the system works in two steps.
> First, press the emergency stop button (basically, just hit the big red thing). ![emergency](Media/PSU/PSU.jpeg) This will cut the power of the freezer instantly, BUT NOT THE POWER OF THE PSU.

Please remember to keep the emergency stop always accessible.

> Then, once the emergency stop is pressed and only the PSU is powered, unplug it for a smooth shutdown.
Please only unplug directly (without pressing the emergency stop) in case of an emergency, as it might damage the system.

## Don't Touch Where You Shouldn't
Some parts of the MCC can be hot, spin quickly, or carry a lot of power. Basically: do not touch the system while it's running. And if you need to, here are the things NOT to do:

> Don't touch the Peltier module while powered (the hot side can be very hot, the cold side quite cold) or if it's covered in thermal paste.

> Don't touch the fans, especially if they are spinning (it can hurt you and damage the blades).

> Don't touch the power connections while plugged in (even if the emergency stop is pressed) to avoid electrocution.

## Other Warnings
> Please ensure the airflow for both the MCC AND the PSU is unobstructed: they need to have sufficient free space.
